# SteamDiscover
Steam products crawler

##IMAC 2015
this was a school projet.<br/>

<b>This crawls through Steam DB and select 4 random games</b><br/>
The engine first removes non-game apps (DLC, trailers, movies, soundtracks...) then select 4 random steam product IDs, and access description, thumbnail, & more !

<br/><br/>BONUS FEATURE ! You can enter a steam User ID and display a list of every.single.game this user owns !
